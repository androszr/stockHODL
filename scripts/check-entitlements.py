"""Refuse drift between the Debug and Release entitlements.

The two files are identical. The one key they are ALLOWED to disagree on is
`aps-environment`, and it is optional: an app with no push capability carries
it in neither file, and that is consistent — it is the state of this app today.
Once either file claims it, both must, each with its own environment: a
distribution build must claim the PRODUCTION APNs environment or App Store
Connect rejects the upload.

Everything else matching is the whole point of the split: a capability added to
one and not the other ships a Release build quietly missing it. Nothing on the
device would say so: the widget simply stops seeing the keychain, or a passkey
ceremony simply fails.

Parsed rather than diffed, so a comment or a reordering is not a failure and a
real key change is. Pass the Debug and Release entitlements paths as arguments
(in that order) to run the guard against doctored copies — that is how its bite
is tested.
