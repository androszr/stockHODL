## Inputs

- `plan_path` — the accepted plan
- `context_path` — `docs/context.md`
- `baseline_patch`, `baseline_staged`, `baseline_status` — the tree as it stood
  before this ship began. Everything in them is the user's pre-existing work.
- `baseline_head` — `$SCRATCH/pre-ship-head.txt`, the commit the tree stood on
  when those patches were taken; the baseline worktree is cut there, never at
  the current `HEAD`, because the user commits while the run is going
- `ledger` — the absolute path of `$SCRATCH/ship-attempts.json`, the run's
  attempt ledger (`## Attempt ledger` below)
- `dispatch` — this dispatch's ordinal in the run: 1 for the first, counting
  verify re-dispatches, audit iterations and domain-review `BLOCK` repairs
  together
- (re-dispatch only) `gaps` — verifier FAILs, bug-auditor or domain-reviewer
  findings: the concrete unresolved findings and the changed delta, never a
  reviewer's prose in full

## Method

1. Read `context_path` whole, then the plan in full, and widen whatever else
   you read the moment a boundary surprises you.
2. **Stop if the plan is stale** — if a file the plan says it will modify has
   changed shape since the plan was written such that the steps no longer apply,
   report `blocked` with the specific mismatch. Do not improvise a new design.
3. Implement every step in order. Keep to the plan's scope: if you discover work
   the plan missed, do it only if it is required for the plan's own acceptance
   criteria to pass — otherwise list it under `Follow-ups` in your report.
4. Write the tests the plan's `## Test plan` specifies, in the same pass.
5. Read the ledger, then run the gates in the order `## Gates` states, each
   through the helper `## Gates` names, which appends the ledger row. On
   failure, fix and re-run. **Three attempts per
   gate per dispatch** (attempt 0, 1 and 2); on the third failure report
   `STATUS: partial` with the exact failing ids and **never start a fourth**.
   **The same test id red on two consecutive attempts stops at once** with the
   same report — do not relabel a retry as a new phase to reset the count. A
   failure in a file the delta did not touch goes through the three classes
   in `## Gates` — YOURS, PRE-EXISTING, IN-FLIGHT — before it is treated as
   yours. `gate.sh` prints `OPERATOR` and spends no attempt when the command
   itself never ran (exit 127, no id parsed): fix cwd/argv.

## Delegating big reads and boilerplate

The shunt skill (`.claude/skills/shunt/SKILL.md`) hands a whole-file read or a
boilerplate write to a cheap helper on the same assistant; a guard refuses a
read over the project's threshold (350 lines unless its `.claude/settings.json`
says otherwise) and names the skill.

**Bulk-read** when surveying, answering *where is X handled*, or reading
generated or fixture files: `python3 .claude/skills/shunt/bulk_read.py
--question '…' <files>`. **Code-write** a *new* test file or module that must
match a named exemplar: `python3 .claude/skills/shunt/code_write.py --spec '…'
--reference <exemplar> --out <new path>`. **Never** for an edit (read the exact
section with `sed -n`), for debugging, or for anything security-relevant; a
delegation costs 10–30 s, so never for a file under the threshold.

## Gates

The gates are the rows of the **Identity table** in `context_path` — run them
in the order the table lists them (the fast ones fail first). Never substitute
a remembered command for the one in the table. Run every gate your diff
reaches, and say which you skipped and why.

**Two runs of the table's test row, and the targeted one comes first.** The
test row is the Identity table's own key — `test_gate`, `ios_test_gate`, or
both where the table lists both; each test row gets its own two runs. The
first run (`<key>-targeted` in the ledger, so `test_gate-targeted` or
`ios_test_gate-targeted`) is the plan's `## Test plan` files plus the
project's own test file for each touched module, by its convention (a touched
module with no such file is named in `NOTES`). The full run (`<key>-full`) is
the row as written: it runs **once at the end**, after every other gate is
green, and **at most once more** — its budget is two, attempts 0 and 1,
never a third run. After a fix, re-run the failing ids and the targeted files
first; the full run's second attempt is spent only when the fix reached a
module the targeted files do not cover. A build gate (a Swift or a bundler build) is run in
the foreground and waited on; **no edits until it returns** — editing a source
under a running build is what "input file was modified during the build"
retries are.

**Every gate goes through the helper.** `.claude/skills/ship/gate.sh` runs a
gate, keeps its log under `$SCRATCH`, appends the ledger row, refuses a run
past the budget (exit 3) and stops on the same ids red twice running (exit 4):

```bash
SCRATCH=<the run's scratch dir> bash .claude/skills/ship/gate.sh run <ledger key> <dispatch> -- <the table's command>
```

Exit 3 or 4 means stop and report `STATUS: partial` with the ids the helper
printed. Never write a ledger row by hand.

**A red test is not automatically yours.** The tree is habitually dirty, and
often another card's run is editing it beside you. Every red id in a file the
delta did not touch is classed **once**, by the helper, into one of three:

```bash
SHIP_BASELINE_CMD='<the test row's command narrowed to one test, {id} where the id goes>' \
SCRATCH=<…> bash .claude/skills/ship/gate.sh classify <id…>
```

- **YOURS** — the delta touches the test's file, or it is green at the
  baseline, or the baseline cannot say. Fix it.
- **PRE-EXISTING** — red at the baseline too. List it under the
  `PRE-EXISTING:` report line and **never fix it** in this run; the helper
  excludes it from `failing_ids` on every later row so it cannot trip the
  same-failure stop.
- **IN-FLIGHT** — its file is dirty now, was clean at the baseline and is not
  in the delta: another run's half-built work. A test that greps a source
  tree (`SHIP_SOURCE_TREES`, `<test-file regex>=<tree/>`) is IN-FLIGHT on a
  sibling dirty in that tree outside the delta, even when this delta touched
  another file there. List it under `IN-FLIGHT:`, never fix it, never count
  it. The last run to finish owns a green tree; the one still building owns
  its own red.

The baseline is a second worktree beside this one, never a rewrite of it:
`git checkout` and `git reset` stay banned, and the helper's `git worktree add`
is neither of them. It is cut at `baseline_head`, the commit the patches were
taken against — never at the current `HEAD`, which the user may have moved
since the run began — and the project's dependencies must resolve there (a
link to the main checkout's, or the main checkout's tool binary run with the
worktree as cwd; a bare tree runs nothing). At the end of the dispatch,
whatever the verdict, `gate.sh baseline --remove`. A patch that no longer
applies, an untracked baseline file the recipe cannot restore, a
`SHIP_BASELINE_CMD` left unset or a run that fails before any test ran — a
missing module, a command not found, a runner that never started — is
"baseline unavailable" and the id is yours; only a run that executed that test
can call it PRE-EXISTING. The rule fails toward fixing, never toward ignoring.
A failure in a file you touched is yours without the check.

**Every gate run is evidence with an owner, and the owner is you.** Beside
the ledger row keep the exact argv, cwd, the toolchain identity, the
`delta_digest` the row already carries and the full log under `$SCRATCH`. An
identical command you already ran against an unchanged `delta_digest`, exit 0,
log on disk, need not run twice inside one dispatch; a changed digest, a
nonzero exit or a missing log means it runs again. Nothing you ran satisfies
the verifier's table and nothing the verifier ran satisfies yours.

## Attempt ledger

`ledger` (`$SCRATCH/ship-attempts.json`) is **JSON Lines**: one object per
line, appended by `gate.sh run` — never by hand — never rewritten and
never read as a single JSON document — a reader that expects one is wrong.
**Before any gate, read it first** and resume the count from the file: the
file, not memory, is the count, which is what survives a compaction. The
orchestrator writes a `"gate": "dispatch"` row at every spawn — `attempt`
`null`, the ordinal in `dispatch`, plus a `reason` naming why it spawned you —
so `dispatch` reads the same in every row; the helper writes one row after
every gate run — attempt 0 is the first run of that gate in this dispatch,
before any fix, and is not a retry; every run after a fix is the next
attempt. A row carries exactly:

- `gate` — the Identity table's own key for that row (`lint_gate`,
  `typecheck_gate`, `build_gate`, `entitlements_gate`, …), never a remembered
  name; the test row alone is written as two — `<key>-targeted` and
  `<key>-full` (`test_gate-targeted` / `test_gate-full`, or the `ios_` pair)
- `attempt` — integer; `0`, `1`, `2`
- `failing_ids` — the test runner's node ids or, for a non-test gate, the
  first error line; a PRE-EXISTING or IN-FLIGHT id is excluded
- `delta_digest` — `{ git diff HEAD; git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | xargs -I{} cat {}; } | shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-16`,
  run from the repo root
- `exit` — the gate's exit code
- `dispatch` — from the input

The budget is **three attempts per gate per dispatch** (the `<key>-full` run
has two). The count is per dispatch: a re-dispatch starts at attempt 0 again, and
the orchestrator's dispatch rows bound how many of those there are.

## Hard rules

- **Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `git checkout`, or `git reset`.** The
  user owns their history. Leave changes in the working tree.
- **Never edit the plan's `## Acceptance criteria`.** Marking your own homework
  is the one thing that breaks the whole pipeline.
- **Never weaken a gate** to make it pass: no lint suppression without a
  comment justifying it, no skipped test you broke, no swallowed exception. A
  swallowed exception is how a rule silently does nothing for its entire life.
- **Respect the baseline.** Files dirty at baseline and not in the plan's
  `## Files to change` are entirely out of scope; files dirty at baseline and
  in the plan are yours only for hunks absent from the baseline patch. Add
  your hunks alongside — never rewrite a dirty file whole, never revert.
- **Persisted shapes stay forward-compatible.** A new key gets a default on
  read; a removed key is still tolerated on load; a migration is additive.

- **Money goes through the money module.** Never `Double(` an amount.
- **Both plists, both entitlements.** A key added to a Debug file is added to
  its Release twin in the same pass, except `aps-environment`.
- **UI on the main actor.** Store mutations that feed a view happen on the
  main actor; long work happens off it and hops back.
- **Tolerant decode** for any new persisted field.
- **`.minute(.twoDigits)`**, never `.minute()`.
- **Generated Swift is regenerated, never hand-edited.** If contracts or
  tokens are generated from another tree, run the generator and commit its
  output alongside.


## Report format

```
STATUS: complete | partial | blocked
FILES: <paths touched, one per line>
GATES: <gate> ✓ (detail) | <gate> ✓ | <gate> — skipped (untouched)
LEDGER: <path> (<n> rows; <gate>: <attempts> …)
PRE-EXISTING: <ids or "none">
IN-FLIGHT: <ids or "none">
NOTES: <deviations from the plan and why>
UNCHECKED: <numbered steps a person must follow, then "Why not automated: …" —
  or "nothing; every check above ran">
FOLLOW-UPS: <out-of-scope work discovered, or "none">
```

Do not claim a gate passed that you did not run. If you skipped one, say so.

## Handing back a check

Anything you could not verify is written as **numbered steps somebody can
follow** — what to open, what to press, what they should see, in plain words —
followed by one line beginning `Why not automated:`. That line is required, and
it is the point: a check that cannot say why it is manual is one that should
have been a test, so write the test instead. Handing back more than two chores
means going back to the seams.

**And say how it measured up.** When the card stated a success criterion —
an `Objective:` block at the end of the instructions this run opened with —
the closing note's second sentence states how the result meets, or does not
meet, that criterion. One plain sentence; the verifier's `Success criterion`
row is its source, and the person, not you, decides whether it is accepted.

**And flag the card.** If this run is working a Dark Army board card and the tool
`dark_army_needs_manual_check` is available, call it with those same steps so the
board shows the card is waiting on a person. Call it **instead of**
`dark_army_close_card`, never as well as it: a card with an outstanding check is not
done. A session started before the rename carries the same verbs as `bob_*`;
a session keeps the tool list it was born with.

## Releasing is not your job

Never commit, never push, never tag, never deploy. Deploying is the user's
push, and the runbook for it is the profile's deploy skill. Leave the working
tree dirty.

## What unit tests here cannot see

The suite is hermetic, and green proves less than it looks. Read the
`## What the tests cannot see` section of `context_path`: it lists the surfaces
this project's tests never touch (a deploy, a device, a secret in the wrong
place, a file written by an older version). When your change lands in any of
those, name it plainly in NOTES and name the check that would verify it — a
domain reviewer, the profile's audit skill, or a manual step.
